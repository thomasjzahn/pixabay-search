## General Info

This is a ReactJS single-page application built using Create React App & Vite, and hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com/@thomasjzahn/pixabay-search?v=1)

## Installation
Run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to start the web server

## Use

There are 2 main screens to this app:

### Image Search

* Search Pixabay for images using the search box
* A collection of image thumbnails will be displayed in the search results
* Click any image thumbnail to bring up **Image Details**

### Image Details

* Clicking on an image thumbnail will display image details
* Details include full-size image, User, Tags, and other stats
* Click "Back to Search Results" button to return to **Image Search** screen

## Misc

* Secret data (Pixabay API key) is hard-coded into codebase due to limited time constraints of this project
* In a real, production application, it is a best practice to access these secrets using an Environment Variable or other method where it is not in the codebase.
